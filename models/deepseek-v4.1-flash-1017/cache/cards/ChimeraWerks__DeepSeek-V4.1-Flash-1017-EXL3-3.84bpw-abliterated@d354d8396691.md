## Performance

Measured 5 November 2026 on production engine `30a9647` with [sparkDash](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash).
All CPU cores in use, with performance cores capped at 3,600 MHz. Prefill used stock GPU clocks; decode capped GPUs at 2,350 MHz.

### Prefill

| Prompt | 4K | 8K | 16K | 32K | 64K | 128K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prefill tok/s | 3,617 | 3,732 | 3,802 | **3,816** | 3,789 | 3,725 |
| Time to first token | 1.31 s | 2.37 s | 4.49 s | 8.76 s | 17.47 s | 35.36 s |
| Prompt tokens | 4,116 | 8,214 | 16,403 | 32,786 | 65,555 | 131,088 |

<p align="center"><img src="assets/chart-prefill.png" width="100%" alt="Two line charts against prompt length from 4K to 128K tokens. Prefill tok/s: 3,617, 3,732, 3,802, 3,816, 3,789 and 3,725. Time to first token: 1.31, 2.37, 4.49, 8.76, 17.47 and 35.36 seconds" /></p>

Cold prompts, zero cached tokens, one request at a time; tok/s comes from time to first token with the collector's
171.55 ms request overhead subtracted.

### Decode

Combined tok/s across all requests at once:

| Requests at once | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 |

Near-empty KV pool, short cached prompts, 400 output tokens per request, one run per point, timed at the engine. Greedy
is temperature 0 with thinking off; thinking is temperature 0.7 with thinking on. All 354 decode streams completed. Every point and

### Clocks

Production serves with GPUs capped at **2,300 MHz**, and the recipe does the same by default. The 3,816 headline is the stock-GPU run; at this cap 32K prefill is 3,711 tok/s, code decode 122 tok/s and 16-request prose decode 260 tok/s.

| GPU cap | 32K prefill tok/s | Peak SoC | Peak GPU | Decode GPU power |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Stock GPU | 3,816 | 94.1 °C | 85 °C | 58.2 W |
| **2,300 MHz (production)** | 3,711 | 86.2 °C | 78 °C | 40.7 W |

Each row is one full suite on engine `30a9647`, with performance cores capped at 3,300–3,600 MHz. Other caps: [clocks.csv](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated/blob/main/benchmarks/v1.2/clocks.csv).

## Run it on three DGX Sparks

The tested setup is exactly three DGX Spark GB10 systems (128 GB each), every pair cabled directly over RoCE. Each
rank file is about 93 GB, so the model needs all three. Budget about 440 GB of free disk per Spark (weights, rank file, Engram rows
and kernel kit) and another 256 GiB on the head for the spill tier. Build the engine first, then follow the
[GitHub recipe](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated#quick-start):

```bash
cp cluster.env.example cluster.env && chmod 600 cluster.env   # HF_REPO and HF_REVISION already pin this repo
./scripts/prep-sparks.sh status   # firmware, 64K kernel, memory saver; apply, reboot, repeat
./scripts/preflight.sh     # check all three Sparks; changes nothing
./scripts/prepare.sh       # download this repo on each Spark, build and verify its rank file
./scripts/start.sh         # start the three ranks and the OpenAI-compatible API
./scripts/smoke-test.sh    # one API request
```

`prepare.sh` downloads this repository to every Spark, builds that Spark's rank file from `tp3/rank<N>.keys` and
checks it against the SHA-256 values in the
[release manifest](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated/blob/main/release/manifest.json).
Hardware, network and memory prerequisites:
[DGX Spark prerequisites](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated#dgx-spark-prerequisites).

`start.sh` caps every Spark's GPU at 2,300 MHz, the cap our production engine serves with. Set `GPU_CLOCK_CAP_MHZ` in
`cluster.env` to pick your own, or `0` for stock clocks; `./scripts/clocks.sh set <MHz>` changes it on running Sparks.

The folder is standard EXL3, but it has only been tested with the TensorFold `dsv41` engine on this three-node setup.

Prefer to let an agent do it? The GitHub README has a
[copy-paste setup prompt](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated#set-up-with-your-coding-agent).

### Call it

The API speaks OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses plus Anthropic Messages, with streaming, tool calls and per-request thinking control. It
listens on the head's loopback; call it there or through an SSH tunnel to port 18002.

```bash
set -a; . ~/ds1017/api/credentials.env; set +a   # on the head: loads SPARK_API_KEY without printing it
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18002/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4.1-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"reasoning_effort":"high"}'
```

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sampling | temperature 1, top_p 1, top_k 20 | Request values win |
| Thinking | on, effort `high` | `"thinking": false` or `"reasoning_effort": "none"` turns it off |
| Effort levels | `minimal` 25, `low` 50, `medium` 62, `high` 75, `xhigh` 88, `max` 100 | Or any integer 1–100 |
| Context | 1,048,576 tokens per request | 8M-token KV pool shared by 16 concurrent streams |

The thinking evals below ran at effort 50 (`low`); IFEval and the chat refusal tests ran with thinking off. Full reference: [serving API](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated/blob/main/serving/README.md).

## Release v1.2

The current production recipe runs engine `30a9647`, native profile `v1.2`, prefill layer slices and the serving API
with native Messages routes. It keeps the same weights as v1.1. Long chat histories use far less memory when building a
prompt, and a returning chat keeps its saved state while it waits in line, so it no longer recomputes from zero. See the
[changelog](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Fidelity

## Quality and refusals

The production engine scored **97.1%** (720 of 755) on the standard set measured 5 November 2026. Arithmetic, reasoning
and tracking each reached 100%; GSM8K scored 96.5%, MMLU 94.4% and QA 92.0%. The task evaluations below measure the same
weights on their own suites.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/chart-quality.png" width="100%" alt="Quality and refusals. GPQA-Diamond 90.5% against DeepSeek's 90.9% at max effort, AIME 2025 97.5%, IFEval 88.7% against the official API's 89.8%, LiveCodeBench v6 88.0%, MMLU-Pro 88.0%. 0 of 100 harmful prompts refused, 97 of 100 complied per HarmBench's classifier, 0 of 250 XSTest safe prompts fully refused with 61 partial" /></p>

| Suite | Setting | Score |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| GPQA-Diamond ([EvalScope](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope)) | 198 questions × 8 repeats, thinking on (effort 50), temperature 1, top_k 20, 32K cap | **90.5%** (1,434 of 1,584) |
| AIME 2025 | 30 problems × 4 repeats, thinking on (effort 50), temperature 1, 32K cap, rule-checked answers | **97.5%** (117 of 120) |
| IFEval | 541 prompts, greedy, thinking off; prompt-level strict (official API, same settings: 89.8%) | **88.7%** (480 of 541) |
| LiveCodeBench v6 | 175 problems, one pass, thinking on (effort 50), temperature 1, 32K cap | **88.0%** (154 of 175) |
| MMLU-Pro | 500-item stratified subset, thinking on (effort 50), temperature 1, 32K cap | **88.0%** (440 of 500) |

DeepSeek reports 90.9% GPQA-Diamond for DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash at maximum effort (100); these runs use effort 50. Quality runs used full-vocabulary sampling (top_k 0) except GPQA-Diamond (top_k 20, the serving default). GPQA ran mostly on engine `7d5b4d8` (greedy output identical) and AIME 2025 on `17800d4`; the rest on `14803a3`.

| Refusal test, greedy | Answered | Partial | Refused |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HarmBench harmful, chat (100) | 98 | 2 | 0 |
| HarmBench harmful, thinking (50) | 18 | 31 | 1 |
| XSTest safe, chat (50) | 49 | 1 | 0 |
| XSTest safe, thinking (25) | 18 | 6 | 1 |

Chat runs use thinking off and 768 output tokens; 50 of the 100 harmful chat replies reached that cap. Thinking runs use 3,072 tokens; 35 of the 50 harmful thinking
replies hit that cap, which is where most partials come from. HarmBench's own classifier
(`cais/HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls`) rates 97 of the 100 chat answers as complied. On all 250 XSTest safe prompts, a local
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct judge with the published rubric found 0 full refusals and 61 partial ones (24.4%); 55 of those are
nonsense-premise prompts, where XSTest's rubric counts rejecting the premise as compliance. Data:

## How it was built

The pack starts from easthambuilds' 3.75 bpw EXL3 base and replaces selected tensors with LibertAIDAI, bertholomus and
LakyFx quantizations. Attention, shared experts and selected gate/up components use higher precision; the
least-used quarter of experts in layers 10–37 uses 3-bit components.

mrfakename's rank-2 refusal-removal edit changes attention `wo_b` in layers 0–31 and shared-expert `w2` in layers
10–39. It was applied to the official FP8 weights in FP32, then the affected tensors were re-encoded at 6 bits with
EXL3 mul1 K6 and an identity Hessian. The edit is baked in; there is no runtime switch.

## Intended use and risks

This model has had its refusal behavior largely removed; the refusal tables above show what remains. It will answer requests the official model declines, including
harmful ones, and it can be wrong, biased or unsafe. Use it for research into quantization fidelity, serving and
refusal behavior, and for applications where you add your own safeguards. You are responsible for how you deploy it
and for complying with the laws that apply to you. Keep the API behind access controls, keep credentials separate and
have people review consequential outputs; see the
[security guidance](https://github.com/ChimeraWerks/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-3x-DGX-Spark-TP3-TensorFold-abliterated/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

Tested scope is text on exactly three DGX Sparks. The base model's image input has not been tested with these weights.
