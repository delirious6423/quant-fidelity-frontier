# GLM-5.3-Flash-oQ2.5e-mtp

This model was quantized using [oQ](https://github.com/jundot/omlx) (oMLX v0.7.1) mixed-precision quantization with Improved oQe Quantization ([jundot/omlx#4385](https://github.com/jundot/omlx/pull/4385)).

A mixed-precision MLX checkpoint of [zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash), a natively multimodal mixture-of-experts model with 320B total and 18B active parameters that combines sparse and linear attention with Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC). It includes the language model, the vision encoder and the multi-token prediction (MTP) head.

The effective average is 3.182 bits/weight for the complete checkpoint.

## Quantization and Bit Distribution

oQ2.5e allocates bits by measured layer sensitivity, then rounds each group with an importance matrix (128 samples x 512 tokens) and a weighted least-squares refit of its scale and bias.

| Storage format | Logical weights | Share of total | Tensor storage | Effective bits/weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Affine 2-bit, group 64 | 164.282B | 51.127% | 47.812 GiB | 2.50 |
| Affine 3-bit, group 64 | 140.123B | 43.608% | 57.094 GiB | 3.50 |
| Affine 4-bit, group 64 | 7.248B | 2.256% | 3.797 GiB | 4.50 |
| Affine 8-bit, group 64 | 8.976B | 2.793% | 8.882 GiB | 8.50 |
| BF16 | 0.607B | 0.189% | 1.131 GiB | 16.00 |
